# Pick-game

 My version of the Pig Game project from Jonas Schmedtmann's course - "The Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert!"

# Description

 This game is a fun and interactive replication of the classic Pig game. It includes two modes:

- 2-Player Mode: Two players can take turns playing against each other.
- Playing with Computer Mode: Player 1 can play against the computer, making it a perfect single-player experience.

# How to Play?

- Players take turns to roll a dice as many times as they wish.
- Points are accumulated during a player's turn.
- If a player rolls a 1:
   - Their turn ends.
   - They lose all points accumulated during that turn.
- Players can choose to hold their current score:
   - This adds the accumulated points to their total score.
   - The turn is then passed to the next player.
- The first player to reach 100 points wins the game!
